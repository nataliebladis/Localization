A final rapid local loading by a small foreshock triggers the subsequent major dynamic rupture and circumvents the large nucleation process of a large patch. White and yellow stars denote epicentres of mainshocks and other events, respectively. As an example, two foreshock sequences accompanied with slow slip are displayed.
